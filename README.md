# test-cft
This android app will show all available information about the bank card, namely:

- Bank ID, or BIN.

- The designation of the bank program by which it issued the card.

In the course of writing the application, the following were used:

- ViewBinding.

- Volley

- Coroutines

- Room

# All bank card information is downloaded from https://binlist.net/.

• When you start the application, the default screen displays the default BIN data from the website listed above. 

• The application has the ability to view requests, provided that the user has already used the application. The entire request history is saved locally and is available at any time.

• If a site/phone/location is present when a BIN is selected, tapping on a particular item will prompt you to go to another application appropriate for that selection.
